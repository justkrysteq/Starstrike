# Starstrike: Alien Assault

A pygame game made during a CodeCamp organized by Kainos.

## ðŸŽ¯ About

**Starstrike** is an action-packed space shooter where players control a spaceship and engage in combat with waves of incoming aliens. The game features three distinct types of alien enemies: small blue aliens, green alien ships, and a massive alien mothership that drops a power-up when destroyed.

Players can collect one of three types of power-ups: enhanced bullets, rapid-fire bullets, and increased ship speed, each providing strategic advantages in battle.

Starting with 20 HP, players advance by defeating enemies and accumulating points. The game concludes when the player's ship is destroyed. Good luck, and may your aim be true as you fend off the alien invasion!
